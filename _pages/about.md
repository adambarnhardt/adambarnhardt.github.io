I'm a PhD student and graduate assistant in Michigan State University's [Department of Linguistics, Languages, and Cultures](https://lilac.msu.edu/linguistics/linguistics-graduate-student/) where I concentrate in sociolinguistics. I work with [Betsy Sneller](https://people.cal.msu.edu/sneller7/), [Suzanne Evans Wagner](https://people.cal.msu.edu/wagnersu/), [Karthik Durvasula](https://people.cal.msu.edu/durvasul/), and others to investigate questions related to sociophonetics/phonology, language change, and the linguistic construction of identity. I am highly involved in the [MI Diaries](https://mi-diaries.org/) project, a large-scale project conducted by the MSU Sociolinguistics Lab that has been remotely gathering acoustic data (through participant self-recording) from hundreds of Michiganders since early 2020.

I am especially interested in finding ways to marry concepts from third-wave sociolinguistics, linguistic anthropology, and sociocultural linguistics with experimental and mixed-methods approaches to address the fundamental questions of language change as laid out by [Weinreich, Labov, and Herzog (1968)](https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/books/directions/5-weinreich):

> (...) a model of language which accommodates the facts of variable usage and its social and stylistic determinants not only leads to more adequate descriptions of linguistic competence, but also naturally yields a theory of language change that bypasses the fruitless paradoxes with which historical linguistics has been struggling for over half a century (p. 99).

Specifically, I strive to investigate the degree and nature of interaction between the dynamics of language change and socioindexical meaning. I am additionally invested in exploring the extent to which these concepts can be integrated within a framework of cultural evolution to offer holistic explanations of the actuation and spread of linguistic change.

Currently, I am working on my dissertation while drafting parts of it into journal submissions; I'm also working as a research assistant for the MSU sociolinguistics lab.
