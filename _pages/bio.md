I'm originally from North Carolina, where there is decidedly much less snow. Before starting at MSU in 2021, I earned BAs in German Studies and English in 2016 and an MA in English (linguistics) in 2020 from [North Carolina State University](https://linguistics.chass.ncsu.edu/). While there, I worked primarily on projects with [Robin Dodsworth](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/rmdodswo/) and [Walt Wolfram](https://chass.ncsu.edu/people/wolfram/), including conducting fieldwork for a [project](https://www.voicesofchatham.org/) collecting acoustic data and oral histories from residents of Chatham County, North Carolina. In my [MA thesis](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/355424532_I_didn%27t_go_to_college_with_anyone_that_country_Age-stratified_indexicality_of_Southern-shifted_vowels), advised by Dr. Dodsworth, I investigated how the perceived age of speakers and the actual age of listeners interact with one another in the way that Southern US English vowels index social information. This was done in a community relatively close to the city of Raleigh, where the Southern Vowel Shift has been shown to be [reversing over time](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-variation-and-change/article/abs/urban-rejection-of-the-vernacular-the-svs-undone/51144D9E1A6FBDFAD33D9671469BAE37).

I have worked with language in various capacities outside of my formal education, including teaching German at a language institute in Chapel Hill, NC and doing linguistic research in Vienna, Austria on a Fulbright-Mach Award. I've lived for extended periods of time in both Germany and Austria, and enjoy returning to visit colleagues and friends when I can.

In my free time, I enjoy reading a good science fiction or fantasy novel, writing fiction, playing story-driven video games, going to see local live music, traveling around Michigan and exploring cool new places with friends, and playing tennis (although I don't do it nearly enough!). I've also recently started getting into cross-stitch!
